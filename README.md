# Alpaseh (Hesapla)

## Description

When I was a child, I usually used calculator for my education. Sometimes, I thought that these numbers looks like letters in my mind. 

I turned the calculator 180 degrees clockwise and realise that some word can be derived with using these numbers. 

We can derive the word goggles using these numbers.

* G : 9 or 6
* O : 0
* G : 9 or 6
* G : 9 or 6
* L : 7
* E : 3
* S : 5

You can see that when we turned these number 180 degree in clockwise, we obtain the letters as below.

As a result, I tried to find all words which includes these letters in English and Turkish Language and put them inside the game.
